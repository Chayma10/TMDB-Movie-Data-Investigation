# TMDb Movie Analysis Project
This is a data analysis project that analyzes a dataset containing information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The dataset includes various features such as user ratings, revenue, production companies, movie genres, and more.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to answer several questions related to movie revenue, ratings, production companies, and other factors that may affect the popularity and success of a movie. The questions that we aim to answer include:

Which are the top 5 movies in terms of revenue?
1. Which type of movies is the most well-rated?
2. Is there a dominant company in movies production?
3. Do shorter movies have a tendency to be more well-rated?
4. Are high-budgeted movies more popular?

## Tools Used
This project uses the following tools and libraries:

* Jupyter Notebook - an interactive development environment for data analysis and visualization.
* Python - a programming language for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
* Pandas - a library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Numpy - a library for numerical computing.
* Matplotlib - a library for data visualization.
* Seaborn - a library for advanced data visualization.

## How to Run the Project
To run this project, you need to have Jupyter Notebook and the necessary libraries installed on your computer. You can install the required libraries using pip or conda.

Download the TMDb movie dataset (tmdb_movie_data.csv) and the Jupyter Notebook file (TMDb Movie Analysis.ipynb) from the project repository.

Open the Jupyter Notebook file using Jupyter Notebook.

Run each cell in the notebook to analyze the dataset and answer the questions.

The results of the analysis will be displayed in the notebook, including graphs, charts, and tables.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this TMDb movie analysis project provides insights into the factors that contribute to the success and popularity of movies. By analyzing the dataset using Python and various data analysis tools, we were able to answer several important questions related to movie revenue, ratings, production companies, and other factors.

This project can serve as a starting point for further analysis and research in the field of movie data analysis and can be extended by adding more features or data sources.
